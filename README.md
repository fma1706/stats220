*This is my Stats 220 repository.*

**I am one of the students for Stats 220. I will be using this frequently for Stats 220 but mostly for my assignments.**

**If you are interested or also taking Stats 220 with me then:**

* follow me [fma1706](github.com).

* check out my attempt for assignment 1 [stats220]().

*You won't find anything fancy here because I am still new to Github.*
